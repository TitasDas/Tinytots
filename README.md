We would like to discover underlying emotions and traits of characters in almost any kind of story. My first step would be to start with fairytales and folklore but anyone is welcome to run these or explore with any kind of novel that they would like. You can find the updated list **here**. 

Personally, I have enjoyed reading fairytales both as a kid and as an adult. Other children's books like Alice in Wonderland have been quoted by a few while teaching/understanding human psychology. These tales embody realities which remain relevant for a child well into their adult life. Traits of characters (or their personality) of a story through text in these stories would also be explored. 

An indirect goal would also be to try and find components in a story that make it 'interesting' for the reader.

## Motivation 

- What is the difference between or are there any differences between fairytales and other kinds of novels (say for adults)? What is that difference, can we describe it or understand it in a better way so as to improve search results or book recommendations?
- How can we generate such stories? What are the "features" that go into a story meant for a child vs an adult? What are the components of a good story?
- Why does one enjoy a particular story or find it interesting?
