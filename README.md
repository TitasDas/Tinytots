The direction initially set for this, is to uncover sentiment or more broadly emotion in almost any kind of text that may be of interest to you as an end user. My first step would be to start with fairytales and folklore but anyone is welcome to run these or explore with any kind of novel that they would like. You can find the updated list **here**.
