The direction initially set for this, is to uncover sentiment or more broadly emotion in almost any kind of text that may be of interest to you as an end user. My first step would be to start with fairytales and folklore but anyone is welcome to run these or explore with any kind of novel that they would like. You can find the updated list **here**.

## Motivation 

- What is the difference between or are there any differences between fairytales and other kinds of novels (say for adults)? What is that difference, can we describe it or understand it in a better way so as to improve search results or book recommendations?
- How can we generate such stories? What are the "features" that go into a story meant for a child vs an adult? What are the components of a good story?
- Why does one enjoy a particular story or find it interesting?
